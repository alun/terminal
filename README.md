# Lighttable terminal plugin

Implemets several routines on top of [Butterfly](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/butterfly)
so you need to have it on your path first

## Installation

Install via LT plugin manager, use Cmd+T to open a new tab with terminal. This will start background butterfly server if required.

There is "Terminal: New" command also availiable for that.

## Disclaimer

This is very initial version, some known bugs are:

* terminal reconnects when moving a tab
* focus sometimes isn't passed smoothly to the terminal when using a keyboard
